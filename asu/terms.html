                                American Sleep Union (Cure My Snore) is so confident that you will find the American Sleep Union Oral Appliance more comfortable and easiest to use than any oral appliance that a dentist provides that if you find the oral appliance not to meet or exceed any of the statements below, American Sleep Union will pay a dentist to fabricate you an oral appliance (American Sleep Union will pay up to $2,000 for the oral appliance).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                American Sleep Union provides a 6 month warranty. ASU will fix or repair the Oral Appliance for 6 months from the date of the original purchase. If the product fails under conditions of normal use, American Sleep Union will repair or replace, at its option, the Oral Appliance. This Limited Warranty does not cover any damage caused as a result of improper use, abuse, damage caused by an animal, modification or alteration of the product.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To make a warranty claim the consumer must return the defective Oral Appliance to American Sleep Union. According to studies performed by hospitals and universities, an oral appliance for sleep apnea and snoring is effective 80% of the time in mild to moderate sleep apnea and is under 50% for extreme sleep apnea. For this reason, American Sleep Union can only guarantees that our oral appliance is as effective as other oral appliances and cannot guarantee the results.
