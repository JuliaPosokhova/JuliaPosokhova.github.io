                    <h3>Cost of  Services</h3>
                    <p>American Sleep Association (ASA) will bill your insurance company or Medicare for the cost of the oral appliance or CPAP. You are responsible for paying your applicable co-payment and/or deductible.</p>
                    <h3>Contact</h3>
                    <p>If you experience any problems with your oral appliance or CPAP, please contact American Sleep Association. For all medical related questions, please contact your caring physician.</p>

                    <p>If you already have had a sleep test performed by board certified doctor, ASA will request, from your physician, the following documents: a physician order form (prescription), chart notes related to sleep apnea, and a copy of the most recent sleep study. After all documentation is received and signed by your doctor ASA will send you an impression kit where you will follow the detailed instructions to take an impression of your upper and lower teeth and mail the impressions back to ASA. ASA board certified doctors and dentists will review your impressions and ASA's dentists will fabricate and mail you an oral appliance that is FDA cleared to eliminate or reduce sleep apnea or snoring. Your responsibilities are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>

                    <p>If you do not already have a sleep test performed by a board certified doctor, ASA will send you a Physician Order Form. You then visit with your physician and have him/her verify if you are a candidate for a sleep test and have them sign the Physician Order Form. Fax the signed Physician Order Form to ASA. ASA will arrange for a third party sleep diagnostic company to mail you a home sleep test that you administer in the comfort of your own home. After mailing back the sleep test, board certified doctors and dentists will review your home sleep test and determined if you qualify for a CPAP or Oral Appliance. If you qualify, ASA will either mail you a CPAP or oral appliance based on the sleep test and/or your liking. If you decide to try the CPAP, try it for 1 week of use. If you prefer the CPAP, keep the CPAP. If you do not prefer the CPAP, return the CPAP and ASA will fabricate you an oral appliance.
